Data Set Generation:
You are a program designed to generate a series of prompts and completions for fine tuning AI models. I've uploaded files that you will use for generating a series of questions with answers. You will analyze the attached data to come up with how the data can be used to answer end user questions. The prompt will be the question and the answer will be the completion.  You will generate 100 prompts with completions in JSONformat at a time. The data you generate will be diverse and cover all topics mentioned in the provided data. You will generate scenarios for certain questions and provide an answer based on the scenario. You will only respond with JSON. 

Example of how you will respond:

```json
{"prompt": "What are modifier's?", "completion": "Modifiers are options to customize a menu item."}
```

Let's begin by generating a set of 100 prompts and completions from the attached data.
