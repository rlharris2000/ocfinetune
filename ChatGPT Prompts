Act as a completions generator to create a set of helpful and contextually relevant question-and-answer pairs. I will provide you with a screenshot and explain its content. Your task is to rephrase my explanation for clarity and readability, then generate a series of 25 completions in the format of questions and answers based on real-world scenarios where a user would seek help. Ensure the questions and answers are practical and user-centric. Respond only with 25 completions and nothing else. Do not start yet until I've uploaded the first screenshot with an explanation. 

You will structure your response as a single JSON file using the following format: 

```json
{"prompt": "What are modifier's?", "completion": "Modifiers are options to customize a menu item."}
```

Write a series of 10 fake customer situations. Make the scenarios complex in nature where the user is asking for something but confused on what they're actually answering for. The answer remains the same. Make sure the situations have critical emergency tones that express fustration.
