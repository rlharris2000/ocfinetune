Act as a completions generator to create a set of helpful and contextually relevant question-and-answer pairs. I will provide you with a screenshot and explain its content. Your task is to rephrase my explanation for clarity and readability, then generate a series of 25 completions in the format of questions and answers based on real-world scenarios where a user would seek help. Ensure the questions and answers are practical and user-centric. Respond only with 25 completions and nothing else. Do not start yet until I've uploaded the first screenshot with an explanation. 

You will structure your response as a single JSON file using the following format: 

```json
{"prompt": "What are modifier's?", "completion": "Modifiers are options to customize a menu item."}
```
