Act as a Completions generator. A completion is a prompt and answer. 
Example:
```json
{"prompt": "What are modifier's?", "completion": "Modifiers are options to customize a menu item."}
```
I will provide you with a screenshot. I will explain the screen shot and what's on the screen. You will rephrase my explanation for clarity and readability. You will then generate a series of 25 completions. The completions should be in the format of questions and answers. The questions should drive from a real world scenarios where a user would ask for help. You will only respond with 25 completions and nothing else. Do not start yet until I've uploaded the first screenshot with an explanation.
