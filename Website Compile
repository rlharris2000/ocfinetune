Quick Service and Fast Casual POS

[3/25/2024 4:27:15 PM]
How many guests can we move through the line today?
The objective in both Quick Service and Fast Casual is the speed of the line movement. This matters
because the shorter your line is, the more people will get in it. The faster your line moves, the more likely

customers are to return.
When the job is done right, revenue in Quick Service or Fast Casual establishments will be directly tied to
the speed of the customer line. OrderCounter has specialized technology to ensure that your line moves,

and moves fast.

Kitchen Display Screens
Kitchen display screens help the kitchen
communicate more efficiently and without

shouting. These screens also produce reporting

to allow comparison of speed and productivity
All Day Screens
Inform your kitchen team of exactly how many orders

of each item that they currently have on order and

also program predictive ordering to inform them of

what is expected in the next 5-10 minutes.
Line Bust with Tablet Solutions
Use a tablet to bust lines both at the counter and in drive thru. This gets orders to the kitchen faster so

your customers can be served sooner and your kitchen can stay prepared.

Serve drinks 
FAST
 while controlling liquor costs
These are some of the roughest environments for POS because of the balance that needs to be met
between speed, customer service, and inventory/cash management.
Bars are the easiest way to lose cash due to theft.
The bartender takes the order, mixes the drink, serves
the drink, and cashes the order out. While there is not perfect solution in this type of environment,
OrderCounter has developed tab and EMV/Chip technologies to reduce the time bartenders need to

interact with the terminals so that they can focus on mixing more drinks while reporting necessary

information to the POS.
We also offer 
multiple liquor control technologies
 to control pours and monitor inventory usage in real
time. For bars that don't prefer this type of pour restrictions we also offer passive inventory tracking
options that will monitor what should have been used at each bar each night or week.

address is pulled up then OrderCounter can

the address falls into so that it can be properly

dispatched for delivery in an efficient manner.
Customer Order History
Save time and avoid errors by easily selecting

historic orders for reorder. We have seen that

72% of orders are similar if not exactly the same

as previous orders.
They have created a convenient system that has not only our staff
impressed but also is leaving our online clientele extremely pleased. We
also provide our online guests' options to place their order on our website;
or if they are a frequent customer they have an option to register with us to
quickly reorder one of their go-to favorites.

In 2007, Thomas and Scott, fueled by the desire to level the playing field for businesses beyond just
restaurants, initiated OrderCounter as an online ordering platform in their garage. Determined to provide a

competitive edge accessible to smaller enterprises, they sought integrations with point-of-sale companies,

only to encounter exorbitant barriers from legacy systems. Undeterred, the self-funded college students

embarked on developing their own POS company, giving rise to the OrderCounter we know today.
As the landscape of technology evolved, our founders recognized the challenges businesses faced with
both legacy and cloud-based systems. To bridge this gap, they ingeniously crafted the OrderCounter Hybrid

POSŠdelivering ease of deployment and accessibility combined with the reliability of a traditional in-house

through word of mouth, serving over 25,000 users globally.
Realizing the pain points of both, our founders have developed technology that merges the benefits of
both, creating an OrderCounter Hybrid POS: easy to deploy and accessible everywhere with the reliability of

a traditional in-house server. Through word of mouth, the growth of our restaurant and channel partner

have accelerated to over 25,000 users worldwide.
Today, we stand as a tight-knit company driven by a passion for simplified service, supporting our channel
partners and business owners in staying competitive in the modern age. Our mission is clear: to be the

best partner our channel partners and businesses have ever had, fostering revenue growth through

innovative point-of-sale solutions

Thomas Barrineau IV,
CEO/Co-Founder
Thomas Barrineau is the visionary co-founder
and CEO of OrderCounter, a leading point-of-

sale company renowned for its cloud-hybrid

solutions tailored for diverse industries.

Thomas embarked on his journey in the

payments industry during high school as a

spirit led him to launch OrderCounter with his

friend and current CTO Scott Dickens as an

online ordering platform in college, evolving it

into the dynamic company it is today.
At the helm of OrderCounter, Thomas

With a wealth of experience in the POS

industry, he spearheads the development and

execution of strategic partnerships and growth

initiatives. Over the years, Thomas has

successfully managed both direct sales and

VAR partner communities, emphasizing the

crucial role of nurturing strong channel

partnerships through the implementation of

community best practices. His unwavering

commitment to excellence propels

important, supporting the growth and
development of strong channel partners

through leveraging best practices in the

community.
Founding Story
In a business landscape where razor-thin margins and high-paced environments define the daily grind, the

journey to establish OrderCounter began with a vision to empower smaller businesses, including those in

the retail sector, with the tools to thrive.
In 2007, Thomas and Scott, fueled by the desire to level the playing field for businesses beyond just
restaurants, initiated OrderCounter as an online ordering platform in their garage. Determined to provide a

competitive edge accessible to smaller enterprises, they sought integrations with point-of-sale companies,

only to encounter exorbitant barriers from legacy systems. Undeterred, the self-funded college students

embarked on developing their own POS company, giving rise to the OrderCounter we know today.
As the landscape of technology evolved, our founders recognized the challenges businesses faced with
both legacy and cloud-based systems. To bridge this gap, they ingeniously crafted the OrderCounter Hybrid

POSŠdelivering ease of deployment and accessibility combined with the reliability of a traditional in-house

server. With a commitment to staying ahead in the ever-changing tech realm, OrderCounter has grown

through word of mouth, serving over 25,000 users globally.
Realizing the pain points of both, our founders have developed technology that merges the benefits of
both, creating an OrderCounter Hybrid POS: easy to deploy and accessible everywhere with the reliability of

a traditional in-house server. Through word of mouth, the growth of our restaurant and channel partner

have accelerated to over 25,000 users worldwide.
Today, we stand as a tight-knit company driven by a passion for simplified service, supporting our channel
partners and business owners in staying competitive in the modern age. Our mission is clear: to be the

best partner our channel partners and businesses have ever had, fostering revenue growth through

innovative point-of-sale solutions
